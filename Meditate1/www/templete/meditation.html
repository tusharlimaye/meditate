                      <h1>ABOUT EACH MEDITATION</h1>
                      <p>These meditations are intended to encourage and inspire thinking and acting in positive ways. They give you a chance to broaden your perspective, which can help you settle yourself down when you are upset or stressed. It may not happen right away, but be confident that with practice, it will!</p>
                      <h2>WELCOMING THE DAY</h2>
                      <p>Meditation can be especially fruitful when transitioning from being asleep to being awake. Begin the day mindfully with this gentle meditation for awakening by focusing on your body’s natural feelings of warmth and peace. Plant the seed of peacefulness when your mind is dawning, just like the new day.</p>

                    <h2>FALLING ASLEEP</h2>
                    <p>Meditation can be especially fruitful when transitioning from being awake to falling asleep. Let go of the day’s stresses and prepare for sleep with this guided meditation. Allow yourself to relax into open awareness, and enjoy your body’s natural warmth and peace as you drift into sleep.</p>
                    <h2>MINDFUL BREATHING</h2>
                    <p>Learn to observe what’s going on inside (your thoughts, feelings and physical sensations) and outside (your interactions and surroundings) with an open mind and without judging, by intentionally bringing your awareness to the sensation of your breathing.</p>
                    <h2>BODY SCAN</h2>
                    <p>Bring awareness to each part of your body, noticing your experience with a sense of curiosity and without judging. We often carry stress and emotions in the body. Becoming aware of sensations in the body can help us recognize emotions and impulses as they arise. We can change habits of reactivity by choosing to settle ourselves down, and respond differently.</p>
                    <h2>ENGAGING YOUR SENSES</h2>
                    <p>Observe what you experience through your senses without labels like good or bad, or pleasant or unpleasant. Learn to notice and experience things as they are, without reacting to or judging them.</p>
                    <h2>MINDFUL WALK</h2>
                    <p>By bringing mindfulness to everyday activities like walking, you can be more attentive to what’s going on inside (your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations) and outside (your interactions and surroundings) without getting caught up in judging or evaluating. Life is a journey. Enjoy a little peace of mind on your path toward your destination.</p>

                  <div class="middle-content1">
                    <h2>BE PRESENT</h2>
                    <p>Listening to the Being Present meditation is about taking a timeout. By focusing on one thing - the sound of running water - you can de-stress and settle yourself down.</p>
                    <h2>GRATITUDE</h2>
                    <p>Appreciate the positive aspects of your life by focusing on the love, kindness and support you have experienced. Through this practice, you’ll gain an increased sense of gratitude, even when aspects of your life need improvement.</p>
                    <h2>CHANGE</h2>
                    <p>Everything is in a constant state of change, all the time. This means that you can work with whatever is going on in your life to grow and improve. When you think about change, you can:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>Learn to be more open, relaxed, tolerant, and flexible... so you are able to go with the flow of life!</p></li>
                      <li><p>Experience more happiness and contentment by coping with strong feelings, like sadness and loss.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Feel more balanced and grounded, whether things are going great, or not so well.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>COMMONALITY OF SUFFERING</h2>
                    <p>Because we all suffer in some way, recognizing the Commonality of Suffering can help you to be:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>Patient and understanding.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Empathetic.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Compassionate - recognizing that we are all in the same boat allows you to develop compassion for yourself, and for other people, whether you know them or not.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Appreciative of what you have.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>CAUSE & EFFECT</h2>
                    <p>Every action has a result. When you engage in positive actions, you increase your chances of having positive experiences, and vice versa. The thing to remember is that whatever you do, it is entirely up to you - you’re in the driver’s seat of your choices and future.</p>

                  <div class="middle-content1">
                    <h2>KINDNESS</h2>
                    <p>Kindness is the wish that others experience happiness. Focusing on kindness helps you to maintain a broader perspective and look at situations beyond your own point of view.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>A broader perspective can help you be less affected by the turbulence of life and remain calm and settled.</p></li>
                      <li><p>If you are having a hard time wishing for the happiness of someone you dislike or who you dislike, try practicing the Commonality of Suffering and Cause and Effect meditations.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>EQUANIMITY</h2>
                    <p>Equanimity is a mental calmness and evenness, even when faced with difficulty. Equanimity allows you to keep an open mind and extend your kindness, compassion, and joy to everyone - even the people you might dislike.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>Equanimity can help you find common ground.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Equanimity also helps you to see the opportunity for positive change in all situations - the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Try the Equanimity meditation to overcome the habit of always judging people or situations</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>COMPASSION</h2>
                    <p>Compassion is the recognition that others are suffering, paired with the sincere wish that they be free from it.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>Shifting your focus from yourself is another way to strengthen your kindness, and your forcefield of peace and calmness</p></li>
                      <li><p>    If you are having a hard time feeling Compassion, try doing the Commonality of Suffering meditation. Just do your best to put yourself in another person’s shoes and try to feel what they are feeling.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>JOY</h2>
                    <p>Joy means rejoicing! Celebrate the positive moments, accomplishments, happiness, skills and good qualities you experience, as well as those of other people.</p>
                    <ul><li><p>If you are having a hard time feeling Joy, especially for other people, try doing the Gratitude meditation.</p></li></ul>
                    <h2>GREAT COMPASSION</h2>
                    <p>Break down the barriers that might interfere with your kindness and compassion. After practicing this meditation, you may notice that you have fewer negative thoughts and that you’ll begin to feel capable of having a positive impact on other people.</p>

                    <h2>RELAX, GROUND & CLEAR</h2>
                    <p>With this guided meditation, use your imagination to relax, feel more stable and grounded, and clear your mind.</p>
                    <h2>JUST LIKE ME</h2>
                    <p>Strengthen your equanimity and compassion by focusing on the idea that everyone wants to be happy and avoid suffering. Then, starting with yourself and extending out to all people, visualize breathing in suffering and pain, and sending out love and happiness.</p>
                    <h2>HEALING SADNESS</h2>
                    <p>Through mindfulness and visualization, approach your sadness with gentleness and an open heart, allowing the intensity of the feeling to dissolve and creating a sense of peace and well-being in its place.</p>
                    <h2>DEALING WITH ANXIETY</h2>
                    <p>Learn to recognize the insubstantiality of anxiety and overcome the uneasy sensation through mindful awareness and visualization.</p>
                    <h2>COMPASSION TOWARD CRUELTY</h2>
                    <p>It’s easy to become stuck in negative emotions for someone who we feel is causing us pain. Meditating in a compassionate way will soothe your difficult feelings and help you become more relaxed when relating to others. When you are calm, you will be able to deal with real problems without being sidetracked by negative emotions.</p>
