                    <h2>WHAT IS MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION?</h2>
                    <p>Mindfulness is a way of paying attention to what is happening right now, by observing what is going on inside (your thoughts, feelings and physical sensations) and outside (your interactions and surroundings) with an open mind and without judgment.</p>
                    <p>Mindfulness helps us stay focused and present when we practice the two kinds of meditation offered in SB&T: Active Thinking, where we intentionally direct our thoughts and imagination to think and feel positively, and Resting the Mind, where we let it all go.</p>
                    <h2>WHAT MINDFULNESS CAN DO FOR YOU:</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>Have you ever been in a bad mood and did not know why? You can practice mindfulness to investigate/figure out what is going on in your head, and to see how it is impacting your feelings and actions.</p></li>
                      <li><p>You can identify and work with nagging, repetitive thoughts that add to stress.</p></li>
                      <li><p>You can change annoying habits.</p></li>
                      <li><p>You can create space between your thoughts and reactions so you do not keep doing unproductive things.</p></li>
                      <li><p>You can create a sense of peace and well-being by strengthening your kindness and compassion.</p></li>
                    </ul>  
                    <h2>WHAT TO EXPECT:</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>All sorts of things come up when you practice mindfulness: thoughts, feelings, sounds, and physical sensations</p></li>
                      <li><p>Sometimes it can feel uncomfortable, other times it goes really smoothly and feels great.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Do not worry - it is all part of the experience. The point is to notice & observe what is going on with an open mind, and to learn not to get hung up on anything in particular. If you get stuck, just bring your attention to something neutral, like your breathing.</p></li>
                    </ul>
